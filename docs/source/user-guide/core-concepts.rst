What is Fuzzy Logic?
-------------------

Fuzzy logic is an extension of classical binary logic that allows for degrees of truth between completely true and completely false. Unlike traditional logic where statements are either true (1) or false (0), fuzzy logic permits partial truth values between 0 and 1.

Why Fuzzy Logic?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Real-world problems often involve:

* **Uncertainty**: Imprecise or incomplete information
* **Vagueness**: Concepts without sharp boundaries (e.g., "tall", "hot", "many")
* **Gradual transitions**: Natural phenomena rarely have sharp cutoffs
* **Human reasoning**: People naturally think in terms of degrees rather than absolutes

Example: Temperature Classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider classifying temperature:

* **Classical logic**: Temperature ≥ 25°C is "hot", < 25°C is "not hot"
* **Fuzzy logic**: Temperature has degrees of "hotness"

  - 20°C: 0.0 hot (completely not hot)
  - 22°C: 0.2 hot (slightly hot)
  - 25°C: 0.5 hot (moderately hot)
  - 30°C: 0.8 hot (very hot)
  - 35°C: 1.0 hot (completely hot)

Fuzzy Sets
----------

A fuzzy set is a collection of objects where each object has a degree of membership between 0 and 1.

Mathematical Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fuzzy set A in universe X is defined by a membership function:

.. math::

   \\mu_A: X \\rightarrow [0, 1]

where :math:`\\mu_A(x)` represents the degree to which element x belongs to set A.

Types of Fuzzy Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ex-fuzzy supports three types of fuzzy sets:

Type-1 Fuzzy Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard fuzzy sets where membership is a crisp value between 0 and 1.

.. code-block:: python

   import ex_fuzzy.fuzzy_sets as fs
   import numpy as np

   # Create a Type-1 triangular fuzzy set
   x = np.linspace(0, 100, 101)
   temperature = fs.fuzzyVariable("temperature", x, 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   
   # Access individual fuzzy sets
   cold = temperature[0]  # Low temperature
   warm = temperature[1]  # Medium temperature  
   hot = temperature[2]   # High temperature

Type-2 Fuzzy Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fuzzy sets where the membership function itself is fuzzy, represented by upper and lower bounds.

.. code-block:: python

   # Create Type-2 fuzzy sets with uncertainty
   temperature_t2 = fs.fuzzyVariable("temperature", x, 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t2)
   
   # Type-2 sets have upper and lower membership functions
   # to model uncertainty in the membership itself

General Type-2 Fuzzy Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most general form where membership is a fuzzy set in three dimensions.

.. code-block:: python

   # Create General Type-2 fuzzy sets
   temperature_gt2 = fs.fuzzyVariable("temperature", x, 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.gt2)

Membership Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common membership function shapes supported:

**Triangular**
  Symmetric triangular shape with three parameters (left, center, right)

**Trapezoidal**
  Flat-topped with four parameters (left, left-top, right-top, right)

**Gaussian**
  Bell-shaped curve with center and width parameters

**Sigmoidal**
  S-shaped curve for monotonic transitions

Example: Creating Custom Membership Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   # Define universe of discourse
   age_range = np.linspace(0, 100, 101)
   
   # Create age fuzzy variable with 4 terms
   age = fs.fuzzyVariable("age", age_range, 4, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   
   # The variable now contains:
   # age[0]: Young (0-30)
   # age[1]: Adult (20-50) 
   # age[2]: Middle-aged (40-70)
   # age[3]: Senior (60-100)
   
   # Evaluate membership for specific values
   membership_25 = age[0].evaluate(25)  # How "young" is 25?
   print(f"Age 25 is {membership_25:.2f} young")

Linguistic Variables
-------------------

Linguistic variables represent concepts that can be described using natural language terms.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

A linguistic variable consists of:

1. **Name**: The variable name (e.g., "temperature", "speed", "quality")
2. **Universe**: The range of possible values (e.g., 0-100°C)
3. **Terms**: Linguistic terms that describe the variable (e.g., "cold", "warm", "hot")
4. **Membership functions**: Mathematical functions defining each term

Creating Linguistic Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   # Automatic partitioning
   speed = fs.fuzzyVariable("speed", [0, 120], 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   # Creates: slow, medium, fast

   # Custom partitioning
   quality_levels = [
       fs.fuzzySet("poor", [0, 0, 3, 5], fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1),
       fs.fuzzySet("average", [3, 5, 7], fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1),
       fs.fuzzySet("good", [6, 8, 10], fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1),
       fs.fuzzySet("excellent", [8, 10, 10, 10], fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   ]
   quality = fs.fuzzyVariable("quality", quality_levels)

Fuzzy Rules
-----------

Fuzzy rules encode human knowledge in IF-THEN format using linguistic variables.

Rule Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Basic Form:**
  IF antecedent(s) THEN consequent

**Components:**
  - **Antecedents**: Conditions (can be combined with AND/OR)
  - **Consequent**: Conclusion or action
  - **Strength**: Rule weight or confidence

Rule Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import ex_fuzzy.rules as rules

   # Simple rule: IF temperature is high THEN comfort is low
   rule1 = rules.RuleSimple(
       antecedents=[temperature[2]],  # high temperature
       consequent=0,  # low comfort class
       weight=1.0
   )

   # Complex rule: IF temperature is high AND humidity is high THEN comfort is very_low
   rule2 = rules.RuleSimple(
       antecedents=[temperature[2], humidity[2]],  # high temp AND high humidity
       consequent=0,  # very low comfort
       weight=0.9
   )

Types of Fuzzy Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Mamdani Rules**
  Output is a fuzzy set

.. code-block:: python

   # IF temperature is hot THEN fan_speed is high
   # Both antecedent and consequent are fuzzy sets

**Takagi-Sugeno Rules**
  Output is a crisp function

.. code-block:: python

   # IF temperature is hot THEN fan_speed = 0.8 * temperature + 10
   # Consequent is a mathematical function

Rule Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rules are evaluated in several steps:

1. **Fuzzification**: Convert crisp inputs to fuzzy membership degrees
2. **Rule firing**: Calculate how strongly each rule applies
3. **Aggregation**: Combine outputs from multiple rules
4. **Defuzzification**: Convert fuzzy output to crisp value

.. code-block:: python

   # Evaluate rule for specific input
   input_values = np.array([35, 80])  # 35°C, 80% humidity
   
   # Create linguistic variables
   temp_var = fs.fuzzyVariable("temp", [0, 50], 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   humid_var = fs.fuzzyVariable("humidity", [0, 100], 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   
   # Rule: IF temp is high AND humidity is high THEN comfort is low
   rule = rules.RuleSimple([temp_var[2], humid_var[2]], 0, 1.0)
   
   # Evaluate rule strength
   strength = rule.eval_rule([temp_var, humid_var], input_values)
   print(f"Rule fires with strength: {strength:.3f}")

Fuzzy Inference Systems
----------------------

A fuzzy inference system (FIS) combines multiple fuzzy rules to make decisions or predictions.

System Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   Input → Fuzzification → Rule Evaluation → Aggregation → Defuzzification → Output
      ↓           ↓              ↓             ↓              ↓
   Crisp      Fuzzy        Rule Strengths   Combined      Crisp
   Values     Degrees                       Output        Result

Components
~~~~~~~~~

1. **Fuzzifier**: Converts crisp inputs to fuzzy degrees
2. **Rule Base**: Collection of fuzzy rules
3. **Inference Engine**: Evaluates rules and combines outputs  
4. **Defuzzifier**: Converts fuzzy output to crisp result

Building a Complete System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   # 1. Define linguistic variables
   temperature = fs.fuzzyVariable("temperature", [0, 50], 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   humidity = fs.fuzzyVariable("humidity", [0, 100], 3, fs.FUZZY_SETS.t1)
   
   # 2. Create rules
   rule_list = [
       rules.RuleSimple([temperature[0], humidity[0]], 2, 1.0),  # Low temp, low humid → high comfort
       rules.RuleSimple([temperature[0], humidity[1]], 1, 0.8),  # Low temp, med humid → med comfort
       rules.RuleSimple([temperature[1], humidity[1]], 1, 0.9),  # Med temp, med humid → med comfort
       rules.RuleSimple([temperature[2], humidity[2]], 0, 1.0),  # High temp, high humid → low comfort
   ]
   
   # 3. Create rule base
   rule_base = rules.RuleBaseT1()
   rule_base.add_rules(rule_list)
   rule_base.antecedents = [temperature, humidity]
   
   # 4. Evaluate system
   test_inputs = np.array([[25, 60], [35, 80], [15, 40]])
   predictions = rule_base.predict(test_inputs)

Classification vs. Regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Fuzzy Classification**
  Predicts discrete class labels

.. code-block:: python

   from ex_fuzzy.classifiers import RuleMineClassifier
   
   classifier = RuleMineClassifier(nRules=15, nAnts=3)
   classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
   predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

**Fuzzy Regression**
  Predicts continuous values

.. code-block:: python

   # Fuzzy regression with continuous outputs
   # (Advanced topic covered in separate guides)

Rule Learning and Optimization
-----------------------------

Ex-fuzzy provides automated methods to learn fuzzy rules from data.

Two-Stage Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Rule Mining**: Discover candidate rules from data
2. **Evolutionary Optimization**: Select optimal rule combinations

.. code-block:: python

   # Stage 1: Mine candidate rules
   import ex_fuzzy.rule_mining as rm
   
   candidate_rules = rm.mine_fuzzy_rules(
       antecedents=linguistic_vars,
       X=X_train,
       y=y_train,
       min_support=0.1,
       min_confidence=0.6
   )
   
   # Stage 2: Optimize rule selection
   import ex_fuzzy.evolutionary_fit as evf
   
   problem = evf.FitRuleBase(
       antecedents=linguistic_vars,
       X=X_train,
       y=y_train,
       candidate_rules=candidate_rules,
       n_rules=20
   )
   
   result = evf.evolutionary_fit(problem, n_gen=50, pop_size=100)

Quality Measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rules are evaluated using multiple criteria:

**Support**
  How often the rule applies to the data

**Confidence**  
  How often the rule is correct when it applies

**Lift**
  How much better the rule is than random

**Accuracy**
  Overall correctness of the rule

**Complexity**
  Number of conditions in the rule

Multi-Objective Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Balance multiple criteria simultaneously:

.. code-block:: python

   # Optimize for both accuracy and interpretability
   fitness_functions = ['accuracy', 'complexity']
   weights = [0.8, 0.2]  # 80% accuracy, 20% simplicity

Interpretability and Explainability
----------------------------------

One of the key advantages of fuzzy systems is their interpretability.

Rule Readability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fuzzy rules can be expressed in natural language:

.. code-block:: text

   Rule 1: IF temperature is high AND humidity is high THEN comfort is low (weight: 0.95)
   Rule 2: IF temperature is low AND humidity is low THEN comfort is high (weight: 0.87)
   Rule 3: IF temperature is medium THEN comfort is medium (weight: 0.72)

System Transparency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can understand:

- Which rules fired for a given input
- How strongly each rule contributed
- Why a particular decision was made

.. code-block:: python

   # Analyze rule contributions
   evaluator = eval_tools.FuzzyEvaluator(classifier)
   rule_analysis = evaluator.rule_analysis(X_test, y_test)
   
   for rule_id, analysis in rule_analysis.items():
       print(f"Rule {rule_id}:")
       print(f"  Fires on {analysis['coverage']:.1%} of cases")
       print(f"  Accuracy: {analysis['accuracy']:.3f}")
       print(f"  Average strength: {analysis['avg_strength']:.3f}")

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visual representation aids understanding:

.. code-block:: python

   # Plot fuzzy partitions
   import ex_fuzzy.vis_rules as vis
   
   vis.plot_fuzzy_variable(temperature, "Temperature")
   vis.plot_rules(rule_base, "Comfort Classification Rules")

Common Patterns and Best Practices
----------------------------------

Variable Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Number of Terms**
  - 3-5 terms usually sufficient
  - More terms = higher precision but lower interpretability
  - Odd numbers (3, 5, 7) often work well

**Overlap**
  - Adjacent terms should overlap by 10-50%
  - No overlap = discontinuous behavior
  - Too much overlap = reduced discrimination

**Coverage**
  - Ensure complete coverage of the universe
  - No gaps between adjacent terms

Rule Design
~~~~~~~~~~

**Rule Complexity**
  - Keep rules simple (2-4 antecedents maximum)
  - Complex rules are harder to interpret and may overfit

**Rule Consistency**
  - Avoid contradictory rules with high weights
  - Similar antecedents should lead to similar consequents

**Completeness**
  - Cover all important regions of the input space
  - Sparse rule bases may have poor generalization

Performance Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Efficiency**
  - Fewer rules = faster inference
  - Pre-compute membership values for batch processing
  - Use appropriate data structures for large rule bases

**Accuracy vs. Interpretability**
  - More rules generally improve accuracy
  - Balance performance with understandability
  - Use multi-objective optimization

Common Pitfalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Over-partitioning**
  Too many fuzzy sets reduces interpretability

**Under-smoothing**
  Sharp membership functions may cause discontinuities

**Rule Explosion**
  Combinatorial growth with multiple variables and terms

**Ignoring Domain Knowledge**
  Purely data-driven approaches may miss important constraints
