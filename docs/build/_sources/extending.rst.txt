Extending Ex-Fuzzy
=======================================

Some of the default behaviour/components can be easily extended to support more fuzzy/explainability tools. 
The whole library is programmed using object orientation, so that the simplest thing to suplant some methods is
to create classes that inherit from the correspondent classes. This is an easy way to implement additional to additional kinds of fuzzy sets.

In the same way, other search algorithms could be used insead of the genetic search as long as they follow ``pymoo:problem`` interface.

In order to change the behaviour of the precomputed partition, this functions can be easily replaced by others, becaouse the format
of their outputs is just list of objects from this library, like ``fs.FS()`` or ``fs.fuzzyVariable()``. 

As long as their membership values are numerical or IV/2-tuple, new fuzzy sets can be easily supported using the ``fs.FUZZY_SET`` enum. So that the rest of the methods will expect a numeric value as the mmebership value (``fs.FUZZY_SET.t1``) or a IV/tuple (``fs.FUZZY_SET.t2``)
