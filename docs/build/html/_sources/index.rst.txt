Welcome to Ex-Fuzzy's documentation!
====================================

**Ex-Fuzzy** is a library to perform fuzzy logic inference using fuzzy logic, with a special focus
on the explainable features of approximate reasoning. Different fuzzy sets are supported, and rules 
are fitted to a dataset using genetic optimization. We also support fuzzy cognitive_maps.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for a few examples.
