Development Setup
-----------------

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/ex-fuzzy.git
       cd ex-fuzzy

3. **Create a virtual environment**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install in development mode**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e ".[dev,test,docs]"

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pre-commit install

Code Style and Standards
=========================

We follow established Python coding standards:

- **PEP 8** for code style
- **Type hints** for all public functions
- **Comprehensive docstrings** in NumPy format
- **Unit tests** for all new functionality

Code Formatting
---------------

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Format code with black
    black ex_fuzzy/

    # Sort imports with isort
    isort ex_fuzzy/

    # Lint with flake8
    flake8 ex_fuzzy/

    # Type checking with mypy
    mypy ex_fuzzy/

Testing
-------

Run the test suite before submitting changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run all tests
    pytest

    # Run with coverage
    pytest --cov=ex_fuzzy --cov-report=html

    # Run specific test file
    pytest tests/test_fuzzy_sets.py

Contribution Workflow
=====================

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Add tests** for any new functionality

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything works

6. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you added"

7. **Push to your fork**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin feature/your-feature-name

8. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
